              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jo Limo provides the travel services presented by the JL Tools
                neither itself nor through third parties. Jo Limo arranges for
                the User simply an entitlement to carriage over a TSP
                independent of Jo Limo.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Therefore, Jo Limo makes the necessary arrangements with the TSP
                in its own name, which provides the User with an entitlement to
                carriage over the TSP (&quot;Third-Party Beneficiary&quot;, also
                called &quot;Contract of Carriage for the Benefit of the
                User&quot;). Consequentially, Users are entitled to demand
                travel services and other claims directly from the TSP.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The User uses Jo Limo only as an intermediate or an arranger and
                not as a transport service. The compensation claim of Jo Limo is
                made up of arrangement fees as well as the advance payment made
                by Jo Limo to the TSP.

                2.2 Conclusion
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                By submitting a completed booking form via the JL Tools or by
                telephone (&quot;Ride Request&quot; of the User) to Jo Limo the
                User makes an offer for the conclusion of an arrangement
                agreement. The object of this agreement is the arrangement of
                the travel service to meet the User&apos;s Ride Request.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jo Limo next sends the User an email confirming the receipt of
                the ride details for the travel service which is to be arranged.
                Through this, Jo Limo confirms only the receipt of the
                User&apos;s Ride Request.
              </p>
              <p>
                The arrangement agreement between Jo Limo and the User for the
                requested travel service comes into effect only through a
                separate statement (&quot;Booking Confirmation&quot;) by Jo Limo
                per email. The User themselves is then entitled to demand the
                transportation services from the TSP directly as well as to make
                further claims directly against the TSP.

                The User can choose between transfer rides and hourly bookings
                for their Ride Request. If, according to the express wishes of
                the User, or guest, the actual Ride Request requires additional
                effort compared to the original Ride Request, the TSP should
                carry this out where possible. The extra effort may result in
                additional costs for the individual arrangement (for more
                details see Paragraph 5 below).
              </p>

                Changes in Travel Arrangements are subject to the availability

                The maximum number of guests and pieces of luggage specified for

                In the case of hourly bookings, each additional 30-minute block
                is considered for invoicing, i.e. from the first additional
